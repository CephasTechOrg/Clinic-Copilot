# Clinic Co-Pilot - Quick Pitch

## One Line
Clinic Co-Pilot streamlines patient intake and helps clinicians see what matters fast.

## Problem
Intake data is fragmented and time is limited, so red flags can be missed.

## Solution
1. Patient submits structured symptoms.
2. Provider adds vitals.
3. AI produces a short clinical brief with priority and red flags.
4. Doctor reviews, edits, and decides.
5. Smart queue auto-sorts by urgency and shows SLA wait badges (Due / Overdue).

## Demo Flow
Patient form -> Provider vitals -> Doctor dashboard decision.

## Workflow Intelligence
- Pending cases are ranked by a triage score (priority + vitals + wait time).
- SLA alerts highlight when HIGH/MED/LOW cases are due or overdue.

## Stack
- FastAPI
- SQLite
- HTML/CSS/JS

## Safety
Assistive only. No diagnosis. Clinician stays in control.
